                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>I'm Elias Tovar, a Computer Science student at Baylor University pursuing a degree with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I'm passionate about building secure, scalable solutions and solving complex technical challenges. My journey in technology combines hands-on experience in IT operations, security monitoring, and software development.</p>

                <p>Currently, I work as a Security Operations Technician Intern at Texas Farm Bureau, where I've gained valuable experience in incident response, security monitoring, and log analysis. I'm constantly learning and adapting to new technologies, always seeking to understand not just how systems work, but how to make them better and more secure.</p>

                <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                <p>My role as a Security Operations Technician Intern at Texas Farm Bureau has given me hands-on experience with real-world cybersecurity challenges. I work with incident response, security monitoring, and log analysis to identify and mitigate potential threats. This position has taught me the importance of attention to detail, quick thinking, and effective communication in security operations.</p>

                <p>Beyond my internship, I've worked as a Personal Shopper and Customer Service Representative at HEB, where I developed strong time management skills, achieved performance benchmarks, and learned the value of teamwork and adaptability in fast-paced environments.</p>

                <hr class="major" />

                <h2>Technical Skills & Interests</h2>
                <p>I'm proficient in <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, with experience building everything from game applications to automation scripts. My cloud computing experience spans both <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> and <strong>Google Cloud</strong>, where I've worked on automating virtual machine deployments and managing cloud infrastructure.</p>

                <p>In the realm of security, I'm experienced with <strong>Active Directory</strong> and <strong>CyberArk</strong> for identity and access management, and I'm passionate about implementing security best practices in everything I build. I believe that security shouldn't be an afterthought—it should be built into every layer of technology from the ground up.</p>

                <h2>Beyond Academics</h2>
                <p>Outside of my technical pursuits, I'm an active member of the Baylor Golden Wave Band and enjoy giving back to my community through volunteer work at St. Margaret Mary Catholic Church and as a tutor at Bagdad Elementary School. I'm also a conversational Spanish speaker, which has helped me connect with diverse communities and colleagues.</p>

                <p>I'm always working on personal projects to expand my skills—from recreating classic games like Tetris in Python to building machine learning models for stock data analysis. These projects allow me to explore new technologies and push the boundaries of what I can create.</p>

                <hr class="major" />

                <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                <p>I'm eager to continue growing as a developer and security professional. Whether it's building innovative applications, securing critical infrastructure, or solving complex technical problems, I'm driven by the opportunity to make a meaningful impact through technology. I'm particularly interested in opportunities that combine my interests in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and software development.</p>
